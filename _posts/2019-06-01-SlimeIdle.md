##### Jun 2019 - Sept 2020

SlimeIdle was a personal project where I aimed to create my own [incremental game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_game) for mobile devices.

I created the game using the Unity engine and programmed the game using C#. As this was my first time using Unity, there was a lot of learning to do. It was fun trying to design and plan out the overall game. Additionally, I learned about the graphical aspects of game development; I designed my own sprites and learned to animate in Unity. However, as the project progressed, I realized that my lack of Unity experience was significantly hindering my progress (especially [prefabs](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Prefabs.html)) and there would have to be a lot of refactoring that needed to be done. However, as my first term at University drew near, I put the project on indefinite hold. While the game is far from something fun and enjoyable, I was happy with the many things I learned and that at least I created _something_ playable.

#### Languages/Technologies: C#, Unity
