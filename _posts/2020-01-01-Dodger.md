Dodger was an Acadmeic project in which I needed to make an application fully in Java. 

For this project, I decided to created a single player arcade style game in which the player can move up or down in order to dodge incoming obstacles. The overall game was relatively simple, with difficulty that slightly increases over time. However, the main aim of the project was to learn and implement various components of software design. Such tasks included implementing data persistence to record high scores, developing a GUI for the game using Swing, and creating unit tests using JUnit. This was definetly a big step for me in learning _proper_ software development.
