##### Jan 2020 - May 2020

Dodger was an academic project in which I needed to make an application entirely in Java. 

For this project, I decided to create a single-player arcade-style game in which the player can move up or down in order to dodge incoming obstacles. The game was relatively simple, with difficulty increasing over time. However, the project's main aim was to learn and implement various components of software design. Such tasks included implementing data persistence to record high scores, developing a GUI for the game using Swing, and creating unit tests using JUnit. This was definitely a big step for me in learning _proper_ software development. 

#### Languages/Technologies: Java, JUnit
