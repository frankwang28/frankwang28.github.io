##### Jan 2022 - May 2022

InsightUBC was a web development course project aimed at providing UBC students with a platform to access information about courses, prerequisites, course averages, and more. 

Using TypeScript, HTML, and CSS, I created a simple front-end interface for easy navigation and a backend system to query JSON data. Furthermore, my partner and I also ensured the reliability of the system by implementing unit testing through the Mocha test environment. This project allowed me to dive into the world of web development, honing my skills in creating efficient and responsive web interfaces, and solidifying my understanding of quality assurance through testing.

#### Languages/Technologie: TypeScript, HTML, CSS

Unfortunately, due to course policies, I cannot provide a GitHub link.
