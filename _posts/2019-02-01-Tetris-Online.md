##### Feb 2019 - May 2019

Tetris Online was a collaborative academic project in which my team created an online multiplayer Tetris game.

Tetris has always been one of my favorite games, maybe because I am a bit of a math guy. For my last high school programming project, two of my friends and I decided to create an online multiplayer versus Tetris game. The game uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, Socket.io, and Node.js, but I primarily focused on the game logic using Javascript. The initial stage was implementing (most) of the [guideline Tetris rules](https://harddrop.com/wiki/Tetris_Guideline). From there, we decided to add our own touch with game modifiers and other custom additions. 


#### Languages/Technologies: Javascript, HTML, CSS, Socket.io, Node.js
