##### Mar 2023 - Apr 2023

Avocado Price Forecasting was an academic project where I explored multiple machine learning methods towards a given problem. 

My team and I reported our findings in a [paper](https://frankwang28.github.io/assets/Avocado.pdf). There are 2 primary types of methods which we explored and optimized: quantitative methods using regression to forecast future prices, and classification methods that try to predict the direction of the price movement for the next trading week, either increasing or decreasing. In addition, we explored the viability of using LSTMs, a type of recurrent neural network, to predict pricing and compare it to existing methods.

#### Languages/Technologies: Python, PyTorch, LaTeX
