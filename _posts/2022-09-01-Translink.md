##### Sept 2022 - Dec 2022

The Translink Database Query Site was a web development project aimed at facilitating data queries related to the Greater Vancouver Transit system. 

Using a combination of HTML, CSS, PHP, and SQL, my team and I designed a user-friendly website that allowed users to access and extract transit-related information efficiently. The query system was made in SQL and contained queries of various complexity. This project not only honed my web development skills but also provided hands-on experience in working with databases, reinforcing my understanding of essential aspects of software engineering.

#### Languages/Technologies: SQL, HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript

Unfortunately, due to course policies, I cannot provide a GitHub link but I can provide a [demo](https://www.students.cs.ubc.ca/~samc5670/route-search.php) (which is hopefully still up but may be taken down as it is hosted by one of my teammates).
